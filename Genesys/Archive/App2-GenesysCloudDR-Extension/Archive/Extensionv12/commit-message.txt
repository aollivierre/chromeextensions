fix(navigation): resolve bookmark navigation environment detection issue

Fix issue where badge shows incorrect environment when navigating between 
environments using bookmarks. Specifically addresses the case where navigating 
from TEST to DR via bookmark would continue showing TEST badge.

Key changes:
- Add explicit detection for bookmark navigation in tab-monitor.js
- Implement tab-specific environment cache clearing for bookmark navigation
- Enhance URL detection to prioritize strong DR patterns
- Modify environment update logic to prioritize DR environment detection
- Add immediate badge updates for strong DR patterns
- Implement multiple verification points for correct badge display

Additional changes:
- Remove unused activeTab permission to address Chrome Web Store rejection
- Update manifest version to 2.5
- Create detailed flow diagram to document extension architecture

This update ensures the badge always shows the correct environment regardless
of navigation method used, improving reliability for users working across
multiple Genesys Cloud environments.
