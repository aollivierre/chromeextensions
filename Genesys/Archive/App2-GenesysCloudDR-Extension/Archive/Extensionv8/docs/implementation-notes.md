### Task 4: Limit position options to top positions only

#### Task 4.a: Verify all code paths only show top left, top center, and top right
- **Completed:** Conducted a thorough review of all code to verify only top positions are used
- **Verification process:**
  - Searched entire codebase for any references to "bottom-" positions
  - Checked all files for any alternative references to bottom positioning
  - Reviewed manifest.json and dr-style.css for any potential references
  - Verified that position handling in popup.js and dr-script.js only process top positions
- **Files verified:**
  - `popup.html` - Only includes top position buttons
  - `popup.js` - Only handles top position selections and defaults
  - `dr-script.js` - Switch statement and default case only handle top positions
  - `dr-style.css` - No bottom position references
  - `manifest.json` - No position-specific settings
- **Current state:**
  - All code paths have been verified to only show or handle top positions
  - No remaining references to bottom positions were found in the active code
  - The extension will only use top-left, top-center, or top-right positions
- **Next steps:**
  - Phase 2: Implement Multi-Environment Support

#### Lessons Learned
- The existing grid layout already worked well with just the top three position options, so no immediate layout adjustments were needed in the HTML.
- Next, we'll need to verify that the JavaScript files (popup.js and dr-script.js) still work with the removed options.
- Optimizing UI details like spacing and button sizes improves the user experience, especially when removing functionality.
- When removing functionality, it's important to ensure all parts of the codebase are updated to reflect the change (UI, styles, and script functionality).
- Simplifying the extension by removing options makes the code more maintainable and focused on the essential functionality.
- When removing features, it's good practice to add cleanup code for any remnants from previous versions (like the dot badge element).
- Setting a recommended default provides better guidance for users while still allowing flexibility.
- Thorough verification is crucial after making changes across multiple files to ensure consistency.

- Using different visual indicators for each environment significantly improves user experience
- Message passing between background scripts and content scripts needs robust error handling
- Organization ID extraction requires multiple approaches (URL and headers) for reliable detection
- Environment-specific settings storage helps maintain state across browser sessions
- Background scripts provide powerful capabilities but require careful permission management

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

#### Fix 1: Enhanced DR Environment Detection
- **Issue:** The DR environment was sometimes incorrectly identified as "unknown"
- **Root cause:** 
  - The DR detection logic was not comprehensive enough to catch all DR URL patterns
  - The environment detection priority wasn't properly maintained
  - The background script could potentially override DR environment detection
- **Solution implemented:**
  - Expanded the URL pattern matching to include more DR-related patterns
  - Added a secondary detection method that analyzes hostname components
  - Added explicit notification from content script to background script when DR is detected
  - Updated background script to preserve DR environment type and not overwrite it
  - Added extensive logging to track the detection process
- **Files modified:**
  - `dr-script.js` - Enhanced detection logic and added notifyDrEnvironmentDetected function
  - `background.js` - Added logic to preserve DR environment settings
- **Current state:**
  - DR environment detection is now more robust with multiple detection methods
  - Clear priority ensures DR detection takes precedence over other methods
  - Consistent environment type is maintained across background and content scripts
- **Lessons learned:**
  - Multiple detection mechanisms provide better reliability
  - Clear communication between content and background scripts is essential
  - Proper priority handling prevents environment detection conflicts

#### Fix 2: URL Fragment Handling for DR Environment Detection
- **Issue:** Specific URLs with DR identifiers in the URL fragment (hash) were not being properly detected
- **Root cause:**
  - The URL fragment (part after the #) was not being included in the DR detection logic
  - Specific organizations like "wawanesa-dr" were not being recognized
- **Solution implemented:**
  - Added dedicated URL fragment detection function (`isDrByUrlFragment`)
  - Added a list of known DR organizations for explicit matching
  - Improved URL handling to include the fragment portion in pattern matching
  - Added tab navigation monitoring to detect DR-related URLs as they load
  - Enhanced logging to show exactly which URLs and fragments are being checked
- **Files modified:**
  - `dr-script.js` - Added URL fragment handling and known DR organizations list
  - `background.js` - Added tab update monitoring for DR detection
- **Current state:**
  - URLs with DR identifiers in fragments are properly detected
  - Specific known DR organizations (like "wawanesa-dr") are explicitly recognized
  - Multiple detection layers ensure consistent identification
- **Lessons learned:**
  - URL fragments require special handling as they may not be part of the main URL
  - For critical identifiers, explicit lists can provide better reliability than pattern matching
  - Navigation events can be used as an additional detection mechanism

#### Fix 3: Fix False Positive Detection for Test Environments
- **Issue:** Test environments were incorrectly identified as DR environments, particularly with URLs containing "directory"
- **Root cause:**
  - The DR pattern detection was too broad and matched "dr" in common words like "directory"
  - URL fragment detection wasn't properly distinguishing between environments
  - Organization ID detection wasn't given the highest priority
- **Solution implemented:**
  - Added a list of excluded words to prevent false positives (directory, drive, drop, etc.)
  - Implemented direct organization ID scanning in the page content
  - Created a more specific pattern matching system for both DR and TEST environments
  - Added a MutationObserver to detect organization IDs as they appear in the page
  - Prioritized organization ID-based detection over URL pattern detection
  - Made environment detection follow a clear hierarchy
- **Files modified:**
  - `dr-script.js` - Added exclude words, organization ID scanning, and improved pattern detection
  - `background.js` - Added more specific pattern matching and exclude words
- **Current state:**
  - Test environments are now correctly identified and displayed with the amber badge
  - False positives from words containing "dr" (like directory) are prevented
  - The detection system follows a clear priority: organization ID > URL patterns > fragments
- **Lessons learned:**
  - Pattern matching needs to be specific to avoid false positives
  - Direct organization ID detection provides the most reliable environment identification
  - Excluding common words is important for accurate pattern matching
  - A clear hierarchy of detection methods helps resolve conflicts between different signals

### Enhancement 1: Test Environment Detection

#### Task 1: Add Wawanesa Test environment detection
- **Completed:** Implemented test environment detection based on organization ID and patterns
- **Changes made:**
  - Added specific organization ID detection for Wawanesa Test: "d9ee1fd7-868c-4ea0-af89-5b9813db863d"
  - Added pattern detection for common test environment identifiers
  - Created dedicated TEST environment detection functions:
    - `checkIfTestEnvironment()` - Primary detection for test patterns in URLs
    - `isTestByUrlFragment()` - Detection in URL fragments/hash
    - `isTestByHostname()` - Detection in hostnames
  - Added TEST organization patterns for "wawanesa-test"
  - Updated background script to support test environment detection
  - Enhanced environment notification to support multiple environment types
- **Files modified:**
  - `background.js` - Added test organization ID mapping and test pattern detection
  - `dr-script.js` - Added test environment detection functions
  - `manifest.json` - Updated permissions and URLs to include pure.cloud domains
- **Current state:**
  - The extension now properly detects test environments via multiple methods
  - Test environments are displayed with amber/orange badge and "TEST ENVIRONMENT" text
  - Specific test organizations like "wawanesa-test" are explicitly recognized
- **Next steps:**
  - Add more organization IDs as they are identified
  - Further enhance detection for other environments
