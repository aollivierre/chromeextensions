# Handoff Prompt: Genesys Cloud Org ID Detection Breakthrough

## Context & Accomplishment

We've successfully developed a minimal Chrome extension that **reliably detects** a specific Genesys Cloud Organization ID (`d9ee1fd7-868c-4ea0-af89-5b9813db863d`) within the Genesys Cloud environment. 

**Key breakthrough**: Our extension definitively confirms the presence of this specific Org ID in browser storage when accessing various Genesys Cloud API endpoints.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Confirmed Detection**: We have verified that the target Organization ID (`d9ee1fd7-868c-4ea0-af89-5b9813db863d`) is consistently present within the Genesys Cloud environment.

2. **Detection Location**: The Organization ID was repeatedly found in browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) when accessing Genesys Cloud API endpoints.

3. **Verified API Endpoints**: The following endpoints reliably expose the target Org ID:
   - `/api/v2/organizations/me`
   - `/api/v2/users/me` (with various expand parameters)
   - `/api/v2/tokens/me`

4. **Working Detection Method**: Content script injection after API requests provides reliable detection by searching for the exact Org ID string in browser storage.

## The Working Solution (Current Approach)

Our current working implementation:

1. Monitors network requests to Genesys Cloud API endpoints
2. Injects a content script that searches for the Org ID in:
   - Browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) - most reliable location
   - DOM elements
   - JavaScript global objects
   - HTML content
3. Logs detection to console with location information

Our solution overcomes previous challenges where direct object inspection or immediate content script injection failed.

## Your Mission: Code Cleanup & Integration

Please help us with the following:

1. **Code Cleanup**: Review our existing projects related to Genesys Cloud extensions and remove any dead/failed code from previous attempts at Org ID detection. Focus only on the detection logic, not UI elements.

2. **Working Example Integration**: Using our minimal extension as a reference, implement our successful Org ID detection approach in any of our larger extension projects where needed.

3. **Badge Preservation**: Preserve and integrate any code related to showing environment badges (DR/TEST/DEV) from our existing extensions. The core badge logic should remain intact.

4. **Optimizations**: If you identify any optimizations to our detection approach, please implement them - while ensuring the detection remains reliable.

## Technical Details

The successful detection is implemented through:

```javascript
// Key insights from our working solution:
// 1. Detection after API requests
// 2. Finding the Org ID in browser storage
// 3. Specific timing with setTimeout to allow for DOM/storage updates

// Example detection function (simplified):
function checkApiResponseForOrgId(targetOrgId, apiUrl) {
  // Check browser storage (most reliable location we found)
  const storageData = JSON.stringify({
    localStorage: { ...localStorage },
    sessionStorage: { ...sessionStorage }
  });
  
  if (storageData.includes(targetOrgId)) {
    return { found: true, location: 'storage' };
  }
  
  // Additional checks in objects, DOM, etc.
  // ...
}
```

## Files In Current Project

1. **manifest.json**: Contains extension configuration and permissions
2. **background.js**: Implements the detection logic and content script injection
3. **README.md**: Documents our approach and findings

Please provide a comprehensive review of what files need to be updated or removed from our larger extension project while maintaining the environment badge functionality.
