# Privacy Policy for Genesys Cloud Environment Badge Extension

**Last Updated:** May 7, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Genesys Cloud Environment Badge extension ("Extension", "we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our browser extension. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our users.

## Information Collection

### Data Collected

The Extension collects the following limited information:

- **Organization Name**: The Extension reads the organization name that appears in the Genesys Cloud interface DOM (Document Object Model). This is done locally within your browser to determine which environment badge to display.

The Extension does NOT:
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Store any personal information
- Track your browsing activity
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- Collect any authentication tokens or sensitive information

### Method of Collection

All data processing occurs entirely within your browser. The Extension uses DOM selectors to identify the organization name displayed in the Genesys Cloud interface. This information is temporarily stored in memory while the Extension is active and is never transmitted outside your browser.

## Use of Information

The organization name is used solely to:
- Determine the appropriate environment badge to display (DR, TEST, DEV, or none for PROD)
- Show a visual indicator of which Genesys Cloud environment you are currently using

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties. Since the Extension processes all data locally within your browser and does not transmit any data externally, there is no data sharing.

## Data Security

Since all processing occurs locally within your browser and no data is transmitted externally, the security risks associated with data collection are minimized. The Extension does not store persistent data.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect or store personal data, there is no personal data for you to access, correct, or delete. The Extension functions solely within your browser session.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the Chrome Web Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
