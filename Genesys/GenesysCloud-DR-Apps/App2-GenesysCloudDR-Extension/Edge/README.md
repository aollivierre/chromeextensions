Good news! Your extension should work in Microsoft Edge with minimal to no code changes since Edge is now Chromium-based. Based on the provided files and Microsoft's guidelines, here's what you need to do:

## Technical Compatibility Check
- ✓ Using Manifest V3 already
- ✓ Simple content script with no Edge-specific incompatibilities
- ✓ No special Chrome-only APIs used

## Preparation Checklist
1. **Package preparation**:
   - Create a zip file containing manifest.json, content.js, and any other assets
   - Ensure your manifest.json has complete information (name, description)

2. **Account setup**:
   - Register for a Microsoft Partner Center developer account if you don't have one

3. **Required assets to prepare**:
   - Extension Store logo (300×300px)
   - Description (min 250, max 5000 characters)
   - Privacy policy URL (if you access/collect personal information)
   - Support contact details
   - Store listing screenshots (optional but recommended)

## Submission Plan
1. Login to Partner Center and create new extension
2. Upload your extension package
3. Set availability (visibility and markets)
4. Complete properties section
5. Add store listing details with required assets
6. Provide testing notes and submit

Since your extension doesn't appear to collect personal information, you likely won't need a privacy policy, but confirm this based on your specific implementation details.

No code changes appear necessary. Your extension should function identically in Microsoft Edge.




You are correct. Based on the new guidelines you provided for porting a Chrome extension to Microsoft Edge, and reviewing your `manifest.json` and `content.js` files, no code changes are required to these specific files.

Here's a breakdown against the porting guidelines:

1.  **API Compatibility**: Your `content.js` uses standard DOM manipulation and JavaScript functions (`document.querySelector`, `createElement`, `setInterval`, etc.), which are fully compatible with Microsoft Edge. It does not appear to use any Chrome-specific APIs that would cause issues.
2.  **Remove `update_url` from manifest**: Your `manifest.json` file does not contain an `update_url` field, so no action is needed here.
3.  **Rebrand if "Chrome" is in name/description**: Your extension's name ("Genesys Cloud Environment Badge") and description ("Displays environment badges for Genesys Cloud based on organization ID") do not mention "Chrome." Thus, no rebranding is necessary within these files.
4.  **`allowed_origins` for native messaging**: Your `content.js` does not use `chrome.runtime.connectNative` for native app communication, so this step is not applicable.

Therefore, your existing `content.js` and `manifest.json` files are suitable for use in your Microsoft Edge extension package as they are. The next steps would be to package your extension and follow Microsoft's publishing guidelines, as you outlined previously.
